Largest tag = 2 ^ 29 - 1
Cannot use tag 19000 - 19999 - reserved by Google
Tags numbered from:
 1 to 15 use 1 byte in space
 16 to 2047 use 2 bytes in space

field for List is "repeated"

// Single line comment
/* Multi line comment */

Default value of fields are as follows:

bool : false
number ( int 32 etc ) : 0 
string : empty string
bytes : empty bytes
enum : first value  , enum must start by tag 0 (which is Default value)
repeated : empty List

No strict checking on the values ( no restriction on values)

protoc -I=proto --python_out=python proto/date.proto
-I = root directory where proto file is saved
python_out = python directory where the file would be created

protoc -I=proto --java_out=java proto/date.proto
creates DateOuterClass.java

Suports both forward and backward compatibility
- Reserve a tag and field name to avoid conflicts when removing fields
- cant mix tags and field name in same reserved statement.

- Alternate to remove a field is to mark it OBSOLETE_field_name

- If a field is missing ,Default would be assumed.
- Default ensures fiels have non null values.
